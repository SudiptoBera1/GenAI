      "Sorting an array in Python can be done using various methods. The most common ways to sort an array (or list) are by using the built-in `sort()` method for lists, or the `sorted()` function. Below are examples of both methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using the `sort()` Method\n",
      "\n",
      "The `sort()` method sorts a list in place and modifies the original list. It does not return a new list.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of using sort()\n",
      "my_list = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\n",
      "my_list.sort()  # Sorts the list in-place\n",
      "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using the `sorted()` Function\n",
      "\n",
      "The `sorted()` function returns a new list that is sorted, leaving the original list unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Example of using sorted()\n",
      "my_list = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\n",
      "sorted_list = sorted(my_list)  # Returns a new sorted list\n",
      "print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n",
      "print(my_list)      # Output: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6] (original list remains unchanged)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Sorting in Reverse Order\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the `sort()` method and the `sorted()` function can sort in reverse order by using the `reverse` parameter.\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Using sort() to sort in reverse\n",
      "my_list = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\n",
      "my_list.sort(reverse=True)  # Sorts in-place in descending order\n",
      "print(my_list)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Using sorted() to sort in reverse\n",
      "my_list = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\n",
      "sorted_list = sorted(my_list, reverse=True)  # Returns a new sorted list\n",
      "print(sorted_list)  # Output: [9, 6, 5, 5, 2, 1]\n",
      "print(my_list)      # Output: [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6] (original list remains unchanged)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Custom Sorting\n",
      "\n",
      "You can also sort a list based on a custom criterion using the `key` parameter. For example, you might want to sort a list of strings by their lengths:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",

      "words = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"fig\", \"cherry\", \"date\"]\n",

      "print(sorted_words)  # Output: ['fig', 'date', 'apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "```\n",
